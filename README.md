### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Used correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for login, one for personal budget, one for the leaderboard
- **CSS** - Application styling that responds to different screen sizes, used good whitespace, color choice, and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, budget displays, leaderboard displays, adding transactions, and routing between pages
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for: 
    - login 
    - retrieving scores 
    - submiting score updates 
    - submitting transaction data 
    - retrieving transaction data 
    - logout
- **DB/Login** - Stores users, tranactions, and scores int the database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't add transactions unless authenticated. Can view leaderboard if not logged in.
- **WebSocket** - As each user gains points through tracking their spending and following their budget, the gained points are broadcast to all other users for the leaderboard
